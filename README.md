## Cats generation

### Installation guide
To install all the dependencies, run
```shell
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

Unfortunately, there is (yet) no script to train the model, but you can follow the steps mentioned in main.ipynb. If you run the notebook locally, download [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spandan2/cats-faces-64x64-for-generative-models) and unarchive it into "data/cats" folder. 
If you upload the notebook to kaggle, you may use it without any extra steps (besides the requirements installation)
